ckrts lets you manage a JSON database of secrets using an external
encryption/decryption command (such as GnuPG).

There are three ways to retrieve stored passwords:
1) The 'showall' command:
   Displays the secret on the terminal
2) The 'paste' command:
   Sends to a program (such as xclip) via a pipe over STDIN
3) The 'xtype' command:
   Emulates user keystrokes using X11's XTEST extension. Will not work
   if you don't have XTEST. This can be seen with the 'xdpyinfo' utility.

- pkg-config
